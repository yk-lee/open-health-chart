# Open Health Chart
To commemorate World Rare Disease Day on Feb 29th 2024, I'm releasing my knee MRIs free for education and academic purposes.

In 2011, I was diagnosed with [PVNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenosynovial_giant_cell_tumor) in my knee, a rare disease that affects about 2 in a million from what I know.  Even rarer, luckily, my condition is stable.  So I don't need surgery or medication.  I merely have to get a surveillance MRI done every year or two.

Having spent so much money on MRIs, why not make full use of it?  People donate organs.  I"m just contributing medical records which have no impact on my insurability.  I hope my data would be of use in education or academia and help advance medicine in time to come.
